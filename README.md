# Ceaser-Cipher

In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely
known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of 
positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after 
Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

The encryption step performed by a Caesar cipher is often incorporated as part of more complex schemes, such as the Vigen√®re cipher, 
and still has modern application in the ROT13 system. As with all single-alphabet substitution ciphers, the Caesar cipher is easily broken 
and in modern practice offers essentially no communications security.
